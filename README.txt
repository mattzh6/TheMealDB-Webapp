How to run our project:
Open index.html.
Click “Find Ingredients” in the navbar at the top.
Type in a search term that is included in the dish the user is looking for in the input field and click the search button. This will find the top three most commonly used ingredients in that dish.
Click “Find Dish” in the navbar at the top.
Type in one or multiple ingredients separated by a single space and click search. This will find dishes that use the inputted ingredients.

Technologies that we used: HTML, CSS, Vega-Lite, Bootstrap, jQuery and JavaScript. We didn’t use TypeScript because we felt that there wasn’t a need for TypeScript in order to implement our application.
